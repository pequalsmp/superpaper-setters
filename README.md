as I could not find the author of the script, on which this is based on.

# Setup

In order to use these scripts, you need to modify your Superpaper settings.

Open ~/.config/superpaper/general_settings in your favourite text-editor
and change/Ğ°dd (if missing) the line "set_command".

For example:

If you intend to use [hyprpaper](https://github.com/hyprwm/hyprpaper), you should set it to:

> set_command=superpaper-set-hyprpaper {image}
